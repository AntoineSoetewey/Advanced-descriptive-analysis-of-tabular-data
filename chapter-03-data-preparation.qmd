# Data Preparation for Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis is only as reliable as the data that feed it. Before measuring associations or building models, analysts must understand variable definitions, clean inconsistencies, and construct analysis-ready tables. This chapter introduces practical workflows for preparing messy real-world data so that later descriptive methods are interpretable, reproducible, and trustworthy.

## 3.1 Understanding Variables and Metadata

### Goals

- Clarify variable meaning, units, and coding schemes
- Detect ambiguous or inconsistent definitions across sources
- Document assumptions and transformations for reproducibility

### Topics

- Data dictionaries and codebooks
- Units, scales, and measurement error
- Categorical coding (ordered vs. nominal)
- Time and panel identifiers
- Provenance and data lineage

## 3.2 Cleaning, Harmonization, and Quality Checks

### Goals

- Identify errors, missingness, and outliers
- Harmonize variables across files or time periods
- Apply minimal, transparent corrections

### Topics

- Missing data patterns and reporting
- Range checks and logical constraints
- Duplicate records and entity resolution
- Standardizing categories and labels
- Dealing with inconsistent time formats

## 3.3 Feature Construction for Descriptive Insight

### Goals

- Create interpretable derived variables
- Encode variables for mixed-type association measures
- Preserve interpretability while enabling analysis

### Topics

- Binning and discretization (with justification)
- Ratios, rates, and per-capita measures
- Index construction and composite measures
- Normalization and scaling choices
- Audit trails for transformations

## 3.4 Reproducible Preparation Pipelines

### Goals

- Make preparation steps transparent and repeatable
- Separate raw, intermediate, and analysis-ready data
- Facilitate collaboration and review

### Topics

- Scripted pipelines vs. manual edits
- Versioning datasets and metadata
- Validation checks as code
- Summary reports for prepared datasets

## 3.5 Applied Example: Preparing a Mixed-Type Dataset

A brief walkthrough demonstrates how a raw survey dataset is transformed into an analysis-ready table with clear variable definitions, cleaned categories, and documented transformations. The focus is on traceability: every transformation is explained, and the resulting dataset is ready for association analysis and visual exploration.
